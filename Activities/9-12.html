                <h1>Georgia Gwinnett College</h1>
                <p>Higher education is a transformative journey of self-discovery, exploration and new experiences.</p>
                <p>GGC combines proven student/faculty engagement practices with small class sizes, individual attention, 
                remarkable facilities and a commitment to experiential learning and critical thinking. Weâ€™re transforming 
                the lives of our students, their families, and through them, our communities.</p>

                <h2>Founded</h2>
                <p>In 1994, Gwinnett County was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a four-year college. 
                    So Gwinnett County leaders purchased 160 acres of land and designated it specifically for the development 
                    of a college campus. GGC opened its doors in 2006 as the first four-year college founded in Georgia in more 
                    than 100 years, and the first four-year, public college created in the U.S. in the 21st century. 
                    Georgia Gwinnett College is a member of the University System of Georgia.</p>
