                <h1 id="top">Georgia Gwinnett College</h1>
                <p>Higher education is a transformative journey of self-discovery, exploration and new experiences.</p>
                <p>GGC combines proven student/faculty engagement practices with small class sizes, individual attention, 
                remarkable facilities and a commitment to experiential learning and critical thinking. We’re transforming 
                the lives of our students, their families, and through them, our communities.</p>

                <h2>Founded</h2>
                <p>In 1994, Gwinnett County was the largest county east of the Mississippi without a four-year college. 
                    So Gwinnett County leaders purchased 160 acres of land and designated it specifically for the development 
                    of a college campus. GGC opened its doors in 2006 as the first four-year college founded in Georgia in more 
                    than 100 years, and the first four-year, public college created in the U.S. in the 21st century. 
                    Georgia Gwinnett College is a member of the University System of Georgia.</p>

                <h2 id="vision">Vision</h2>
                <p>Georgia Gwinnett College will be a premier 21st Century Liberal Arts College where learning will 
                    take place continuously in and beyond the confines of the traditional classroom. Its cornerstones 
                    will be innovative use of educational technology and a commitment to an integrated educational experience 
                    that develops the whole person. GGC will be a wellspring of educational innovation. It will be a dynamic 
                    learning community where faculty engagement in teaching and mentoring students will be the hallmark. 
                    It will be a driving force for change in student success. As such, it will be a model for innovative 
                    approaches to education, faculty engagement with students, and highly efficient student, facility, and 
                    administrative services.</p>
