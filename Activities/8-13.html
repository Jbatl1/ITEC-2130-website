        <h1>Georgia Gwinette College</h1>
        In 1994, <i>Gwinnett County</i> was the largest county east of
         the Mississippi without a four-year college. So 
         Gwinnett County leaders purchased 160 acres of land 
         and designated it specifically for the development of 
         a college campus. GGC opened its doors in <b>2006</b> as the 
         first four-year college founded in Georgia in more 
         than 100 years, and the <ins>first four-year, public 
         college created in the U.S. in the 21st century.</ins> 
         <i><b>Georgia Gwinnett College</b></i>is a member of 
         the <mark>University System of Georgia.</mark>
